Must Haves:
---

* Manual Hand Shuffle button. (I won't even bother if this isn't implented, seriously)

* AI function - Preferbly a more intelligent one than Percy's

* Specatators being able to join on-going Duels

* Proper card artwork. So; clear images, consistency and preferbly cutting all the unnecesary info (like Booster Pack details).
	-This includes seperate card files for all Alternative artwork for cards (including TCG/OCG differences)

* Chatroom with functional Friends List
	-Including Private Message options

* Ability to challenge someone in the Chatroom to a duel

* Ability to Host games with/without Password


Less Important, But Super Fun:
---

* Turbo Duels

* Customizable Banlists (I know this can be done manually, but it's a hassle)

* Customizable Cardpools (Again, know it's manually possible, but ehhh... effort is too much)

* Anime cards, but ONLY with a proper Anime banlist, made by a group of avid Anime Duelists. Otherwise, might as well do without to save space

* Random Ladder matchmaking
	-Random (non-Ladder) matchmaking
	-Random (non-Ladder) matchmaking with a pool of preselected players

* Tournament Mode

Most Likely Impossible:
---

* RPG elements, mimicking the old Yugioh Online games. Even a YO3-ish system would be great and a lot easier to make than YO2.

* Chatroom staff with common sense
