Functions of admin and mod personelle... Well admins right away is Access, he'll hire, fire, promote, demote and give instructions to everyone. The difference is Access will actually lead us and help us instead of bark orders and sit back. Mods are made by access and they are there to keep order, Access i do wish there was some way in the coding we could put for mods to interfere in matches if there are complaints, that way the mods can act quickly and without much commotion. As for how i fit into it, thats up to Access to decide. There should be at least 3 levels. Admin being the highest, high mod- they can ban, kick, perma ban, mute etc and low mod- this will be for starter mods or staff who are mainly focused on coding and the workings of the game. they will have limited powers like kick, mute, ban. if i am not mistaken we are going to use IRC, so admin would have @, high mod will have & (the mod boss might have @ as well) and for the coders they will have a +
