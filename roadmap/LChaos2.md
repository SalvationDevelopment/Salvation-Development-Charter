The chat room rules

-Should have a well defined hierarchy system (user, mod, admin) that is easy to understand for everyone.  No excessive subleveling.

The client

-Should NOT have an internet browser inside of it.  When going to a site, should just open the preferred browser.
-Avatar icons for users, since apparently everyone wants it.
-Replays should be some form of video format rather than a set of instructions for the game to follow.  Easy uploading.
-A minor chat bot that handles super common chat rule infraction
-Some form of matchmaking rating if we're going to have a ranking system.  Does not need to be visible.
-A news/events tab would be great.
-A tournament mode

The Game

-If we can have DuelingNetwork style card images (where they have a template, and we just need to put in card text and the card image), that would be great
-A nice card search function.  Percy style was cool.
-Victory/Defeat music should not loop.
-The Structure Deck duels from Yugioh WC 2011 game.  Doesn't have to be limited to structure decks.
-If we're going to have hand shuffling, force it to happen every start of MP1, rather than having an optional button.

Identity
-Magi Magi Magician Gal is still my favourite and I still want her to be mascot.  If impossible however, try finding a monster that are not part of any archetype for a suitable mascot.
-DevPro's colors are black and orange.  It's a bit hard on the eyes (well mine at least).  We should have softer colors.
